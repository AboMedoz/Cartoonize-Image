# Cartoonizer with OpenCV 

This project applies real-time image processing techniques to transform webcam input into a **cartoon-like representation**. It uses **edge detection**, **bilateral filtering**, and **thresholding** to simplify colors and emphasize outlines, mimicking the look of hand-drawn cartoons.

---

## Features
- Live webcam feed with cartoon effect applied in real-time.
- Bilateral filtering for smooth, flat color regions.
- Adaptive thresholding for crisp, bold outlines.
- Option to save snapshots of cartoonized frames.
- Easily extendable for other edge detection techniques (e.g., Sobel, Canny).
